the arduino_communication file holds the source code for my stm32L476 master to talk with an arduino slave over spi.
there is some problem in the arduino code that makes it not function properly. 
my code proves that the stm32 can send data and recieve data via interrupts
the data the arduino recieves over SPI is printed to a terminal application over UART
when data is recieved by the stm32 over SPI, if it is the correct data, an LED lights up 

in the STM32_comm file is the source code for two of my stm32 boards talking over SPI
